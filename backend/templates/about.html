      <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <div class="about-content-wrapper">
          <p>REST for the Wicked is a text adventure game illustrating some of the basic concepts and interactions 
            that define the REST framework. It was created by Justin Majetich and Geoffery Zoref as a portfolio project 
            for Holberton School. Our aim was to complement the range of text-heavy resources that exist 
            online by providing an interactive, spatial-visual explanation of REST.</p>

          <p>We were inspired by educational coding games like <a href="http://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a>
            and <a href="https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/">Untrusted</a>, as well as text adventure games of the 80s and 90s. In deciding 
            on a format for the project, we felt a text adventure game would make an intuitive analog to REST interaction. A touchpoint 
            for art direction was the early Macintosh HyperCard aesthetic. To approximate this look, game assets were created using 
            <a href="https://www.cloudpaint.com/classic">Cloudpaint</a> - a web-based emulation of MacPaint v1.5.</p>

          <p>You'll navigate the world of REST for the Wicked using the interface pictured above. Your main instrument of interaction with the game world is the request bar, 
            located in the UI's top module. You'll use it to navigate and manipulate the game world.</p>

          <p>We've modeled the request bar after an actual REST request. To make a request, drag a method, path, key, and item tile onto
            the bar and execute the request. For example, you could use the 'GET' method tile and the '/lobby' path tile to move to the lobby.

      </div>
      <p>As you explore the world, you'll collect items and keys, which can be used to access or interact with certain rooms. To use an item, 'POST' or 'PUT' it to a path, as pictured below. You can think of a 'POST' request as placing an item in a room, while a 'PUT' request uses the item to change the room's state.</p>

      <p>As you explore the game world, you'll collect methods, items, and keys. These are stored for use in their respective invetories. You're also provided a map to orient yourself within the world.</p>

        <h2>In Memory</h2>
        <div class="about-content-wrapper">
          <p>On February 28, 2021, Geoff passed away. He was kind, as I knew him, and had a pure enthusiasm for programming. His sense of humor would occasionally wander into the mischievous, and I think, if he could look back now, heâ€™d relate to the title of our game in an amused, ironic sort of way. To create is such a gift and, even more so, to create together. May this project stand as a small memorial to Geoff and his boundless curiosities. Rest in peace.</p>
